            <p><strong>Project Summary:</strong></p>
            <p>My Every Picture studio project is currently a page that displays one of my many interests, growing my plants. On the page you can see a scrolling animation of pictures of my three plants and to the right of that is the information display. The information within the display includes basic information on the plant and why I named my plant the name it has.</p>
            <p><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>
            <p>I will be focused on improving the UX/UI of my Every Picture project. I plan on doing this by taking the feedback I got and redesigning the composition of my page. I will be adding more clear instructions for users and filling in the empty spaces on the page with more options such as music, art, etc. My Every Picture project will then cover more of my interests and the UI of my page will have better development within the new composition. In the new composition, I plan on making it very obvious what the user can do, the information display will be centered, and going around the side of the display will be animations of my interest, in their categories. I plan on redesigning the header with a better-designed title and including options to see information with a click from a nav menu.</p>
            <p><strong>Expert Feedback:</strong></p>
            <p>I received feedback from Andy Do, a UC Davis alumni and professional designer as well as Heidi Tang an undergrad who is extremely well-versed in UI/UX design. The main point for iteration was to make it more obvious how users should interact with the page, ideas for this are to move the sections to be in reading order (left to right), allowing users to select a plant without having to hover the scroll animation, or adding an image/arrow/diagram to indicate how to hover on a plant. 
            Other notes I took to improve the UI were spending up the scroll animation, more graphic design behind the title, and filling the outskirts of the page with graphics or more hoverable information.</p>
