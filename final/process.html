                                <strong>Can you walk me through what you are doing and why?</strong>Hovering over a plant because it says to, clicked back to portal page because it was there<br>
                                <strong>How do you feel about the layout/design of this page/screen?</strong>Hard to read, expands across whole monitor<br> 
                                <strong>Are there any elements that confuse you or that you find difficult to understand?</strong>Cant scroll to chose a plant, have to wait for it to scroll down<br>

                                <strong>Were there any features or functionalities missing that you expected to find?</strong>Smaller window is better, on larger screens you cant really see all the text, clicking on the picture instead: "once I moves the mouse the information doesnt remain"<br>
