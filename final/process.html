                                <strong>Just glancing at the page, what are your expectations for what the page is for?</strong>       It tells you to hover over a plant<br>
                                3. During Task Execution:<br>
                                <strong>Can you walk me through what you are doing and why?</strong>    Hovering over a plant because it says to, clicked back to portal page because it was there<br>
                                <strong>How do you feel about the layout/design of this page/screen?</strong>   Hard to read when it expands across whole monitor<br> 
                                <strong>Are there any elements that confuse you or that you find difficult to understand?</strong>  Cant scroll to chose a plant, have to wait for it to scroll down<br>

                                <strong>Were there any features or functionalities missing that you expected to find?</strong>      Smaller window is better, on larger screens you cant really see all the text, clicking on the picture instead: "once I moves the mouse the information doesnt remain"<br>
                                <strong>What aspects do you like the most?</strong>     The auto scrolling<br>

                    If she hovers over the plant she will get more info on it<br>
                    3. During Task Execution:<br>
                    Can you walk me through what you are doing and why?<br>
                    At first, read the text in the big box because it showed up first, then looking at the pictures moving, just hover over each picture to see the information <br>
                    How do you feel about the layout/design of this page/screen?<br>
                    Looks nice, feels like it is all readable, contrast colors look good, the font size is good, and pictures aren't blurry <br>
                    Are there any elements that confuse you or that you find difficult to understand?<br>
                    Confused about the moving plants, thought she had to click but it was just a hover <br>

                    Were there any features or functionalities missing that you expected to find?<br>
                    Clicking to stop an image, if she hovers over an image and accidentally moves away she can no longer read the information; can't move the cursor <br>
                    What aspects do you like the most?<br>
                    Likes the scrolling animation <br>

                    Do you have any additional comments or feedback?<br>
                    Really cute, and functions well. Likes to use the cursor to read so it would be easier if the information stayed while not having to hover the images

                    Can you walk me through what you are doing and why?<br>
                    Scroll over the pictures, if i click the plant it gives me a description of color, age, name, and care of the plant <br>
                    How do you feel about the layout/design of this page/screen?
                    Accessible, can't scroll down on the plants: have to wait <br>
