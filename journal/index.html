                <h2>Optimal Practices for Modals/Overlays</h2>
                <date>Jan 30, 2024</date>
                <p>Modals or overlays serve as a distinctive window within the existing web page structure, providing developers with the ability to construct an independent, interactive layer atop the elements on the page. To navigate this design landscape effectively, it's crucial to close modals, allowing users to seamlessly transition back to the parent page. Modals, often in the form of pop-ups, strategically interrupt user interactions, typically collecting data or unveiling additional information.</p>
                <p>Yet, easily overlooked and becoming an intrinsic part of our online routine, despite their unassuming nature, these modal gems play a vital role in data collection and can be tailored for various intentions, subtly guiding users through their digital journey.</p>
                <p>It's worth noting that modals have become so ingrained in our online interactions that we might be unaware of their prevalence. They seamlessly integrate into the web landscape, often prompting users with essential messages, such as the playful reminder to 'accept your cookies'â€”a nod to the ubiquitous cookie consent prompts. When developing modals, ensure they align with design elements such as window structure, type hierarchy, buttons, and text, contributing to a seamless and visually cohesive user experience.</p>

                <h2 class="right">Research Form Design</h2>
                <date>January 23, 2024</date>
                <p>
                I conducted quick form design research and found that designing forms has a particular set of standards to aid in the users navigation. An approach that focuses on ensuring conciseness, by including only relevant information, aims to prevent cognitive overload and create a form that is easy to read and follow. Usually, forms are structured in a single column to guide users through a seamless vertical motion, with exceptions made for small content items like zip codes or states.</p>
                <p>To enhance user experience, it is beneficial to display a progression indicator, allowing users to track completed steps and gauge the remaining ones. When it comes to form mannerisms, consider marking questions that require answers with an asterisk. Place more complex questions towards the end, beginning with simpler ones. Additionally, provide support text to explain formatting requirements rather than using placeholder text. Use labels instead of placeholders to maintain clarity while users input information, and if providing examples, incorporate supporting text.</p>
                <p>For a sleek design, adjust the size of fields based on content length. Default values, although requiring thorough research, can significantly reduce the information users need to input. When utilizing drop-down or multi-select questions, carefully choose the format that best suits the question and form guide, such as checkboxes or radio buttons. Avoid generic button labels like "submit" or "send" and opt for labels that align with the form's purpose.

                <p>In my own expereinces with forms I have usually had something to complain about within the design. A form I'm very familiar is the FAFSA Student Aid form. The navigation of the form is fairly easy to follow, often times there is an icon for additional information but the form is so lengthy it's difficult to complete in one sitting. A great thing about this form is that you can save and come back to a saved point of progress on the form.
