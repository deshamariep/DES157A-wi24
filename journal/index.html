                I conducted quick form design research and found that designing forms has a particular set of standards to aid in the users navigation. An approach that focuses on ensuring conciseness, by including only relevant information, aims to prevent cognitive overload and create a form that is easy to read and follow. Usually, forms are structured in a single column to guide users through a seamless vertical motion, with exceptions made for small content items like zip codes or states.
                
                To enhance user experience, it is beneficial to display a progression indicator, allowing users to track completed steps and gauge the remaining ones. When it comes to form mannerisms, consider marking questions that require answers with an asterisk. Place more complex questions towards the end, beginning with simpler ones. Additionally, provide support text to explain formatting requirements rather than using placeholder text. Use labels instead of placeholders to maintain clarity while users input information, and if providing examples, incorporate supporting text.
                
                For a sleek design, adjust the size of fields based on content length. Default values, although requiring thorough research, can significantly reduce the information users need to input. When utilizing drop-down or multi-select questions, carefully choose the format that best suits the question and form guide, such as checkboxes or radio buttons. Avoid generic button labels like "submit" or "send" and opt for labels that align with the form's purpose.</p>

                <p>In my own expereinces with forms I have usually had something to complain about within the design. A form I'm very familiar is the FAFSA Student Aid form. The navigation of the form is fairly easy to follow, often times there is an icon for additional information but the form is so lengthy it's difficult to complete in one sitting. A great thing about this form is that you can save and come back to a saved point of progress on the form.
                
                The link to the website is below but the form can not be accessed without an account and varification.</p>
